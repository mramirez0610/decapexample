### what's this all about?

this website was created using Decap CMS and Next.Js. Decap is a headless CMS that allows you to create and manage content for your website, while Next.Js is a React framework that enables you to build fast and dynamic web applications. together, they provide a powerful and flexible platform for creating modern websites that are easy to maintain and update. Decap allows me to create a website that allows others to easily create, edit, and manage content in a user-friendly interface. the reason I decided to focus on creating a headless CMS is because freelancing is something that I've always been interested in, and I wanted to find a freelance setup that I can get started with. to accomplish this I wanted to create a simple static site that only displays markdown content, so that the entire website is editable using the CMS.

### how can i get me one of these?

if you'd like to test the interface out, let me know! i'm here to give you a quick tour of how everything works, and how it could benefit you with any small projects you've been working on. ideally, this would be a freelance service that i can market, and hopefully help market someone's passion product/project.
