test: "### what are you talking about?

a headless cms is a content management system that doesn't have a front end. it's just a database that you can use to store and manage content. you can then use that content in any way you want, like in a website or an app. this site is an example of a headless cms. the content is stored in a database, and the site is built using that content. the site is built using a headless cms called [decap cms](https://decapcms.org/).

### why should i care?

because it's neat! imagine this scenario: you paid someone to make you a website, and now you want to update it. you have to go into the code, make the changes, and then deploy the site. if you're not doing that, you have to contact the person who made this website for you, and ask them to change a paragraph or two. with a headless cms, you (the client) can update the content in the cms without even messing with the source code, and the changes will be reflected on the site. no need to touch the code. it's quick, it's efficient."
